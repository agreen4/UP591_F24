## Milestone Description

The MUP capstone provides MUP students with the opportunity to apply what they have learned through their courses and internships to a specific planning problem or issue, and therefore to demonstrate their professional competence to both the faculty and potential employers. Students work independently to decide on a capstone topic and approach with the assistance of the department academic adviser and faculty.

There are three pathways to satisfy the MUP capstone requirement:

**Plan Making Workshop:** Exposure to professional planning practice by completing two plan making workshops. The audience for the projects completed in these workshops is typically planning and policy practitioners and decisionmakers. Faculty workshop leaders work in partnership with an institution, organization, or community partner to determine the scope and deliverables from the workshop in advance. Typical workshop deliverables may be a report, a plan, or other professional quality work.

**Master's Project:** A professional project or analysis focusing on a topic relevant to the student's selected concentration and career goals. The audience for a master’s project is typically planning and policy practitioners and decisionmakers. The capstone deliverable may be a report, a plan, or other professional quality work. The project is conducted for or with an external client.

**Master’s Thesis:** A scholarly applied or basic research work conducted under the formal Thesis Guidelines of the Department and Graduate College. The audience for a master’s thesis is typically academic and applied researchers. The thesis option is most appropriate for MUP students with a strong interest in pursuing a research-oriented career or PhD degree.

## Milestone Deliverable

**Poster:** Participate in the Capstone Poster Session, held near the end of the spring semester in the second year. Note: Students completing their degree in December must submit a poster for the subsequent spring's poster session but they need not be physically present at the session if they have already graduated.

**Final Products:** Submit the capstone final products, including electronic copies of the capstone and poster (PDF) to the Director of Graduate Studies.

Submit a completed **Capstone Exit Form** including all required signatures to the Director of Graduate Studies.
