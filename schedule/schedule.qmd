Our weekly seminar sessions are approximately three hours in length. For most sessions, we will divide out time into three 50-minute chunks:

- **Learn:** Introduction of new material, concept, or deliverable.

- **Reflect:** Individual or group discussion based upon what's been introduced.

- **Review:** Peer review and small group reflection on each others' work.

On the sidebar, you will find a week-by-week description of each seminar session and any related deliverables.
